# 碎碎念
还没有想好在Github服务器上部署什么内容，因此目前只做了一个跳转页面用于跳转到我的服务器的个人网站上。

即是这只是个简单的跳转页，也做了一些炫酷的样式与效果，如果你喜欢也可以应用到自己的项目中😀

# Notes
I haven't figured out what to deploy on my Github server yet, so I just made a redirect page to my server's personal website.

Even though this is just a simple jump page, it also has some cool styles and effects, and you can apply it to your own projects if you like.😀
